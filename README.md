# User-Behavior-Analysis-A-A-B-Testing-in-a-Food-Commerce-App
This project analyzes user behavior within a food commerce mobile application to understand interaction patterns, evaluate conversion performance, and assess the reliability and impact of A/A/B testing. The analysis supports data-driven product decisions by validating experiments and identifying opportunities for UX and funnel optimization.
# Objectives
Analyze user behavior across key stages of the conversion funnel
Evaluate event frequency and user engagement patterns
Validate data quality and group equivalence using A/A testing
Assess the impact of interface changes through A/B testing
Support product and business decisions with statistical evidence

# Dataset Description
The dataset contains event-level user interaction data, including:
User identifiers and experiment group assignments
Event names and timestamps
Conversion funnel events (views, cart, purchases)
Experimental groups for A/A/B testing

# Tools & Technologies
Python
Pandas & NumPy
Matplotlib
SciPy (statistical testing)
Jupyter Notebook

# Methodology
Data cleaning and preprocessing
Exploratory analysis of user behavior
Funnel analysis and conversion rate calculation
A/A test to validate experiment setup and data consistency
A/B test to evaluate the impact of UI changes
Statistical hypothesis testing and interpretation of results

# Key Insight
User behavior varies significantly across funnel stages
A/A testing confirmed no statistically significant differences between control groups
A/B testing revealed measurable changes in conversion rates
Results provide guidance for UX and product optimization

# Results & Impact
This project demonstrates practical experience in user behavior analysis, experimental design, and statistical validation, directly applicable to product analytics and growth-focused roles.
